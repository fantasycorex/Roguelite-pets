# Roguelite Pets - Development Milestones

## Phase 1 — Vertical Slice Prototype

### Milestone 1 — Project Foundation
- [x] Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite project setup.
- [x] ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest configuration.
- [x] Responsive canvas resolution & scaling manager (Desktop + Mobile Landscape).
- [x] Scene skeleton setup: BootScene, PreloadScene, HabitatScene, DefenseScene.
- [x] Scene transitions and UI container overlays.
- [x] Geometric placeholder graphics generator for pet, enemies, tower, and background.
- [x] Basic automated smoke tests validating core event bus and state initialization.
- [x] Project documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `milestones.md`).

### Milestone 2 — Combat Sandbox
- [x] Fixed path tile/coordinate system for defense map.
- [x] Central structure (Tower) with HP and damage handling.
- [x] Enemy spawning pipeline along fixed path (3 placeholder enemy types).
- [x] Autonomous creature pathfinding/patrol logic around central structure.
- [x] Auto-targeting system for nearest enemy in attack range.
- [x] Normal creature attack execution & hit detection.
- [x] Enemy destruction and basic wave completion criteria.

### Milestone 3 — Roguelite Progression
- [x] Experience points system for creature during runs.
- [x] Wave end trigger -> Trait selection phase (`TRAIT_SELECTION`).
- [x] Seeded deterministic RNG engine for trait generation (`SeededRandom`).
- [x] 3 random trait choices offered per wave clear.
- [x] Trait application system (stat boosts, special attacks, attack speed buffs).
- [x] Creature special ability implementation.

### Milestone 4 — Habitat & Pet Care
- [x] Habitat phase (`HABITAT`) state management.
- [x] Pet stats: Hunger (0-100) and Affection (0-100).
- [x] Feed interaction: Consumes food item, reduces hunger, increases affection.
- [x] Pet interaction: Direct tapping/rubbing pet, increases affection.
- [x] Simple pet visual states & micro-animations (idle, happy, hungry).
- [x] Care-to-Combat bonus: High affection/full belly grants stat multipliers during defense runs.

### Milestone 5 — RPG Loot & Equipment
- [x] Enemy coin drops on defeat + coin collection mechanic.
- [x] Loot drop table system (coins + equipment drops based on enemy type).
- [x] Single equipment slot system (Accessory slot).
- [x] Core inventory data structure and equipment stat modifiers.
- [x] Habitat UI for equipping, unequipping, and viewing pet stats.

### Milestone 6 — Complete Vertical Slice
- [x] 5-Wave defense run loop with increasing difficulty.
- [x] Explicit game phases: `HABITAT`, `PREPARATION`, `DEFENSE`, `LOOT`, `TRAIT_SELECTION`, `RESULTS`.
- [x] Victory (Wave 5 clear) and Defeat (Tower destroyed) conditions.
- [x] End-of-run Results screen displaying summary stats, coins gained, and permanent EXP.
- [x] Versioned local storage save/load system (`SaveManager`).
- [x] Temporary developer test controls (instant win, add coins, trigger level up).
- [x] Game balancing pass for waves, enemy health, damage, and traits.

### Milestone 7 — Presentation & Polish
- [x] High-contrast clean vector/sprite placeholders.
- [x] Web Audio API SFX implementation (`SoundEngine` - attacks, hits, coin pickup, pet sounds).
- [x] Audio mute/unmute toggle controls.
- [x] Particle systems (floating care popups, hit impacts, enemy death bursts).
- [x] Screen shake camera effects on damage.
- [x] Onboarding tutorial modal overlay.

## Phase 2 — Playable Alpha Roadmap

### Milestone 8 — Vertical Slice Hardening
- [x] Centralised, idempotent run reward settlement (`RunRewardSettlementService`).
- [x] Guaranteed one-time enemy death rewards (`rewardGranted` & lifecycle state).
- [x] Proper handling for every trait effect type (`special_ability` unlock, `moveSpeed` patrol scaling, `creatureMaxHp`).
- [x] Preserve all save fields during partial updates (`SaveManager.updateSaveData`).
- [x] Implement save schema version 2 and migration tests.
- [x] Replace hard-coded total-wave UI values with values derived from `WAVES_DATA.length`.
- [x] Add explicit `tutorialCompleted` save flag instead of inventory inference.
- [x] Add regression unit tests for reward settlement, death rewards, trait unlocks, and save schema migrations.

### Milestone 9 — Data-Driven Combat 2.0
- [x] Typed definitions for `MapConfig`, `TowerConfig`, `CreatureCombatConfig`, `AbilityConfig`, `EnemyBehaviourConfig`, `StatusEffectConfig`.
- [x] Creature current HP & downed state handling (5-second revive timer).
- [x] Enemy behavior variations:
  - Fast runners (`Shadow Runner`) ignoring pet to rush tower.
  - Tanks (`Void Golem`) stopping to attack pet (`fight_creature`).
  - Ranged enemies attacking from path.
- [x] Patrol & interception speed driven by creature `moveSpeed`.
- [x] Targeting modes: Nearest, Closest to tower, Lowest HP, Highest threat.
- [x] Status effects engine: Slow, Burn, Poison, Stun, Shield.
- [x] Data-driven normal & special abilities (`abilities.data.ts`).
- [x] Developer pause, resume, and game speed controls (1x, 2x, 4x).
- [x] Exit condition: New ability, enemy behavior, or map addable primarily through typed data without modifying `CombatEngine`.

### Milestone 10 — Creature Identity, Level and Evolution Framework
- [ ] Separate `CreatureSpeciesConfig` from `OwnedCreature` saved state.
- [ ] Initial 3 starter creatures with distinct roles:
  - **Guardian** (High HP, taunt/block, benefits strongly from affection).
  - **Spark** (Ranged lightning/AoE, lower HP, benefits from full belly).
  - **Prowler** (Fast interception, crit/attack-speed builds).
- [ ] EXP level-up thresholds & multi-level run resolution.
- [ ] Evolution prerequisites and alpha stage 2 evolution per starter.
- [ ] Save migration from legacy single-profile schema.

### Milestone 11 — Roguelite Build System 2.0
- [ ] Expanded trait triggers: `on_hit`, `on_kill`, `on_critical`, `on_special`, `on_tower_damaged`, `periodic`, `status_application`, `ability_modifier`, `conditional_stat`, `tower_support`.
- [ ] 4 core build families: Ferocity, Swiftness, Elemental, Guardian, Companion.
- [ ] Trait tags, stack limits, prerequisites, and upgrade chains.
- [ ] Weighted rarity, duplicate protection, 1 reroll per wave, and current-build HUD panel.
- [ ] Target pool of 20–24 traits for alpha.

### Milestone 12 — Maps, Enemies and Boss Encounter
- [ ] Map 1 — Heartwood Clearing (Introductory layout).
- [ ] Map 2 — Moonlit Crossing (Dual merging paths, multi-threats).
- [ ] Expanded enemy roster: Gloom Beetle, Shadow Runner, Void Golem, Spitter, Wisp, Saboteur.
- [ ] Boss encounter with telegraphs, 2 phases, minion spawns, vulnerability windows.

### Milestone 13 — Habitat, Equipment and Economy 2.0
- [ ] Food inventory & 3 food types with distinct effects + shop.
- [ ] Petting cooldown/diminishing returns & mood indicators.
- [ ] Equipment slots: Collar, Charm, Toy.
- [ ] Item instance IDs, equip comparison, selling, and fixed stat rolls.

### Milestone 14 — Alpha UX, Accessibility and Playtesting
- [ ] Title screen, settings menu, separate audio volumes.
- [ ] Touch target parity & keyboard accessibility.
- [ ] Screen shake toggle, reduced motion, colorblind rarity indicators.
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI pipeline, Playwright automated browser tests, deployment to GitHub Pages / itch.io.
